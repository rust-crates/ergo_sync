//! ergo_sync: making creating and synchronizing threads ergonomic, therefore fun!
//!
//! This is the synchronization library as part of the `ergo` crates ecosystem. It contains useful
//! types, traits and functions for spawning threads and synchronizing them. It is named `sync`
//! because of `std::sync` and because it is _not_ async, which is a spearate part of the
//! ergo ecocystem.
//!
//!
//! The crates that are wraped/exported are:
//!
//! - [`rayon`](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon): Rayon: A data parallelism library for Rust
//! - [`chan`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/chan): Multi-producer, multi-consumer concurrent
//!   channel for Rust.
//!
//! Consider supporting their development individually and starring them on github.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Here is an example of all of the features together:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[macro_use] extern crate ergo_sync;
//! use ergo_sync::*;
//! use ergo_sync::rayon::prelude::*;
//! use std_prelude::*;
//!
//! # fn main() {
//!  // rendezvous channel
//! let (send, recv) = chan::sync(0);
//!
//! // The consumer must be spawned in a thread or we risk deadlock.
//! // Do NOT put the consumer in the threadpool, as threadpools
//! // do not guarantee >1 threads running at a time.
//! let consumer = spawn(move|| -> u64 {
//!     let recv = recv;
//!     recv.iter().sum()
//! });
//!
//! // spawn and join N number threads
//! join_pool!{
//!     {
//!         // Use "regular" functions that might have to do a lot of work.
//!         let s = send.clone();
//!         // do some expensive function
//!         s.send(42_u64.pow(4));
//!     },
//!     {
//!         // Each function can also use rayon's traits to do iteration in parallel.
//!         let s = send.clone();
//!         (0..1000_u64).into_par_iter().for_each(|n| {
//!             s.send(n * 42);
//!         });
//!     }
//! };
//!
//! drop(send); // the channel must be dropped for iterator to stop.
//! assert_eq!(24_090_696, consumer.finish());
//! # }
//! ```

/// Spawn multiple threads and then join them. These are run in the rayon threadpool and are not

/// This is slower than using _either_ `rayon::join` or rayon's parallel iterators and requires
/// heap allocations. See the rayon documentation for [`scope`](../rayon/fn.scope.html) for more
/// details and alternatives.
///
/// Although it is less efficient than other APIs exposed by rayon, it can be unergonomic to use
/// rayon directly when you want to run more than 2 workloads in parallel. This _is_ ergonomic and
/// for most use cases is _efficient enough_.
